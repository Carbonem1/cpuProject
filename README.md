CPU Project
-----------

Build a CPU of some sort in Logisim.
It should be programmable, but the program does not need to be in RAM (it could be in a separate ROM).
Prove it by implementing some program.
For example:

	Mad-libs
	Fibonacci or hailstone sequence

Work in pairs.
Split work up into separate circuits.
